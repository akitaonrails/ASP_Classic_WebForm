<p class="subtitle"><a name="purposes"></a>Purposes of a new Session model</p>
<p>One of the most handy features of the built-in ASP COM components is the Session. 
It allows for user&acute;s data persistence with almost zero effort from the developer. 
The drawback to this component is that it was made with a bad design and therefore 
it doesn&acute;t scale.</p>
<p>The problem is that it saves the data in local physical files. So in a load 
balanced topology scenario, if a user goes to Server 1, some data is saved there. 
When he requests the next page the load balancing system will redirect him to 
a Server 2 that doesn&acute;t have this user&acute;s previous data so the persistence 
is lost.</p>
<p>The workaround for this situation is to ignore the built-in Session and develop 
a new one with scalability in mind, for example, saving it in a central storage 
server that can hold the data in files or in a database but the important thing 
is that all Web Servers must point to this single centralized point of storage. 
So, no matter where the user is redirected: each server will know exactly where 
to retrieve the necessary data.</p>
<p>This is whas SessionPlus provides: the replacement for Session. It&acute;s 
not a 100% perfect system but can hold 99% of the situations pretty well. Plus, 
it adds the notion of DataAdaptors. There is already a default Adaptor called 
SQLDataAdaptor that stores the data in a pre-defined database table. If there&acute;s 
the need for a more specific kind of storage, for example, to save the state in 
XML files, the developer can implement the IDataAdaptor interface (described below) 
and bind it with the SessionPlus component. As long as it correctly implements 
the IDataAdaptor interface it will know what to do. It&acute;s a flexibility for 
situations where the default database table lacks some very specific feature. 
But again, 99% of the situations will probably fit well with the standard approach.</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="package"></a>The SessionPlus Package</p>
<p>The first object to be instantiated is the SessionPlus package. It has a method 
CreateInstance that acts as a factory. With this object you can create the Session 
and SQLDataAdaptor objects. Here&acute;s a complete example of creation:</p>
<pre>
Set SessionFactory = Server.CreateObject( "SessionPlus" )
Set objSession = SessionFactory.CreateInstance( "Session" )
Set objAdaptor = SessionFactory.CreateInstance( "SQLDataAdaptor" )
objSession.DataAdaptor = objAdaptor	' binds the 2 objects together
</pre>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="idataadaptor"></a>The IDataAdaptor Interface</p>
<p>As explained before, this model allows for a flexible data manager system. 
You can implement any custom component on top of this interface. As long as it 
implements the same properties and methods, it can be linked to the Session component 
and therefore be used transparently to send and retrieve data to any kind of data 
source.</p>
<pre>
Class IDataAdaptor
	' get the Session container

	Public Property Let Parent( ByRef obj )
	End Property

	' get/set a Dictionary object from the caller object
	Public Property Get Items
	End Property
	Public Property Let Items( ByRef obj ) 
	End Property

	' get/set expiration date for the current values (must be set before Commit)
	Public Property Get Expire
	End Property
	Public Property Let Expire( dtTmp )
	End Property

	' check if the connection do exists
	Public Property Get IsReady : IsReady = OpenConnection() : End Property
	
	' check if the given UserID already exists
	Public Function Exists( strID )
	End Function

	' go down to the database and query the saved user data
	Public Function Retrieve
	End Function
	
	' save the users data
	Public Function Fetch
	End Function
End Class
</pre>
<p>Properties</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Session Parent (get)</span><br>
It will be assigned at the time the Session container binds to the Adaptor;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Dictionary Items (get/set)</span><br>
Allows the assignment of an external Dictionary. In the case of a Retrieve operation 
this will be the save point. In the case of a Fetch operation this will be the 
source point;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">DateTime Expire (get/set)</span><br>
This is the expiration date that will be assigned to the current set of session 
values;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool IsReady (get)</span><br>
Verifies if the Adaptor is ready to do Retrieve or Fetch operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Methods</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool Exists( String strID )</span><br>
Check if the given UserID already exists. This method helps the Session container 
when it&acute;s generating a new UserID;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool Retrieve</span><br>
Once the Adaptor is correctly connected to the Session Container, it can query 
the storage and load the data of the current user;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool Fetch</span><br>
Once the Adaptor is correctly connected to the Session Container, it can save 
the current user data to a storage.</li>
</ol>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="sqldataadaptor"></a>The SQLDataAdaptor Component</p>
<p>This is the default adaptor that implements the interface described above. 
There are a few particular settings that it requires: as this is an SQL Database-based 
Adaptor it will require some database configuration in order to work. A working 
example would be:</p>
<pre>
' (1) instantiate objects
Set SessionFactory = Server.CreateObject( "SessionPlus" )
Set objSession = SessionFactory.CreateInstance( "Session" )
<b>Set objAdaptor = SessionFactory.CreateInstance( "SQLDataAdaptor" )</b>

' (2) configure the adaptor
<b>objAdaptor.ConnectionString = "DSN=PMIDB;UID=pmiuser;PWD=pmiuser"
objAdaptor.IsOracle = False</b>

' (3) configure the container and bind the adaptor to it
<b>objSession.DataAdaptor = objAdaptor</b>
objSession.Load

' (4) make operations in the session
objSession.setItem( "test", "value" )
Response.Write objSession.getItem( "test" )

' (5) finish the session (or data will not be stored) and clean up memory
objSession.Commit
Set SessionFactory = Nothing
</pre>
<p>Steps (1), (2), (3) must be always in the very beggining of the page and the 
step (5) must be in the very end of the page. Anyway, the operations -- as in 
(4) -- must be necessarily between those steps. Actually the important thing is 
that the operations goes after a Load operation and before the Commit. (the container 
code will be detailed in the next section).</p>
<p>The extended properties are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="methodproperty">String Tablename (get/set)</span><br>
the name of the table that has the default structure (shown below)</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">String ConnectionString (get/set)</span><br>
the string used to open the connection. For example: &quot;DSN=pubs;UID=sa;PWD=sa&quot;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">ADODB.Connection Connection (get/set)</span><br>
instead of providing a string to open a new connection, you can assign an already 
opened connection;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool IsOracle (get/set)</span><br>
Oracla and MS SQL Server have some differences so this property allows for the 
correct construction of queries and commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default table is called tbSessionPlus (although you can change it thru 
the TableName property). The default structure for this table is as follows:</p>
<pre>create table tbSessionPlus (
	userid	varchar2( 40 )  not null,
	keyname	varchar2( 100 ) not null,
	value	text            not null,
	expiration	date	    not null
)
</pre>
<p>And the user specified in the ConnectionString must have select, insert and 
delete grants to this table or the operations will fail. It&acute;s a good practice 
to have a separated user that only controls this table. A custom component could 
require a different structure when the system needs more information to be stored, 
but this one is the smallest structure to offer a minimun of control. You can 
extend it but try not to cut pieces off.</p>
<p>It&acute;s also a good idea to set a scheduled script that cleans old sessions 
out along with the transactional log once in a while (once a week or every noon). 
The following command can erase the old sessions (for Oracle and MS Server):</p>
<pre>
(Oracle)    delete from tbSessionPlus where expiration < SYSDATE
(SQLServer) delete from tbSessionPlus where expiration < GetDate()
</pre>
<p>Remember that user data is private (this is an axiom, don&acute;t question), 
and although it&acute;s always stored in a Base64 encoded format (human unreadable), 
it&acute;s always a good practice to wipe out every temporary user information 
like this as it can become a single-point-of-failure in the case an external agent 
(as a hacker) can gain access to this data. Another good reason is that this table 
eats up considerable amount of space so cleaning both old sessions and transactional 
log once in a while won&acute;t hurt.</p>
<p>Last detail: the .Fetch operation depends on a transactional operation as each 
saved value is a separated insert command. You have to ensure that all the values 
are stored at once, without errors -- or nothing is stored at all, or we could 
have an inconsistent operation. So never turn transactions off in the database 
you choose to hold the session data.</p>
<p class="subtitle"><a name="session"></a>The Session Component</p>
<p>Finally, the Session Container. This component aggregates the value manager 
operators and allows an external Adaptor that implements IDataAdaptor to be used, 
as explained above. Even though all the Adaptor details was explained above, the 
bottom line is that the developer will often use it directly. If you look at the 
working example above you will see that all the work with the Adaptor is in instantiating 
it, giving it correct connection data and linking it to the container. Then all 
the operations will be taken care by the Session component and everything can 
be done thru the interface exposed here.</p>
<p>The working example is shown in the section above, so let&acute;s simply list 
the exposed properties and methods of this component:</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="methodproperty">String UserID (get)</span><br>
allows the component to expose the users current read-only ID.</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Int Timeout (get/set)</span><br>
this property controls the expiration of the current Session. It allows the input 
of an integer number that expresses times in the format of minutes. So if you 
do .Timeout = 10, it means 10 minutes since the object was instantiated. If you 
never set this property, the session will expire instantly after the user closes 
he&acute;s browser, otherwise the session will persist until the expiration timeout 
is reached or an explicit command of abandon is released;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">IDataAdaptor DataAdaptor (set)</span><br>
binds the container with an external Adaptor as explained before;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Int Count (get)</span><br>
return how many itens are stored in the current Session</li>
</ol>
<p>Methods</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="methodproperty">String getItem( String/Int key )</span><br>
retrieve a stored value through it&acute;s key name or through it&acute;s position 
in the list. For example, both .getItem( &quot;test&quot; ) or .getItem( 0 ) will 
work for the example shown in the previous section;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">void setItem( String/Int key, String strValue 
)</span><br>
as the previous method, it allows to insert an item through a new key name or 
change an existing value through it&acute;s key name or it&acute;s position in 
the list. So, the value created in the previous example can be updated using both 
.setItem( &quot;test&quot;, &quot;new value&quot; ) or .setItem( 0, &quot;new 
value&quot; )<br>
A <b>VERY IMPORTANT</b> point to remember is that Sessions only accept discrete 
values, so never ever try to store references to objects. For example: never try 
to store a Recordset object in a Session. (This is true for both this SessionPlus 
package and the built-in ASP Session);</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">String getKey( Int intIndex )</span><br>
retrieves the name of the key name of the item in the given position. The previous 
example would allow for .getKey( 0 ) to return the key name &quot;test&quot;;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool hasItem( String strKey )</span><br>
checks if the given key name exists in the current list of items;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">void RemoveAll</span><br>
explicitly allows to clean up all the data in the user&acute;s current Session;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">void Load</span><br>
this method will do the job of querying the Adaptor and retrieve any persisted 
data of the current user. If this is the first time the user opened the current 
Session than it also creates a new UserID;</li>
<li><span class="methodproperty">Bool Commit</span><br>
after all operations are made with the current user&acute;s session data then 
you have to call Commit. It will order the Adaptor to store the current data. 
If nothing was changed (all the data was used for read-only purposes) then the 
Adaptor will never be asked to store anything.</li>
